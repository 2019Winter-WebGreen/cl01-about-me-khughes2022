        <!-- This paragraph is about my family -->
        <h4> Family</h4>
        <p>My full name is <b>Kayla Carmella Ann Hughes</b>.  <!-- "Ann" is my Comfirmation name --> I have brown eyes and brown hair.  I attend Padua Academy High School <!-- In Delaware --> and live in Pennsylvania.  I have four other family members and six pets.  I have two siblings; one brother, one sister.  My brother has three bearded dragons and one gecko, I have one bearded dragon, and my family shares one dog.  </p>

        <!--  This paragraph is about my pet's names -->
        <h4> Pets</h4>
        <p>Most of my family's pets have weird names. We have a familial theme with our lizard names.  The eldest lizard is named "Mr. Dragon." Two of his younger lizards are named "Baby Dragon" and "'Lil Dragon".  My lizard is named "Cousin Dragon." Our dog has somewhat of a normal name, "Rocky."</p>

        <!-- This paragraph is about my famil's heritage and genetics -->
        <h4> Heritage and Genetics</h4>
        <p>My Mom's side of my family is 100% Italian.  My Dad's side of the family is Irish and Scottish.  My siblings and I are all tan and dark haired like my Mom but act <em> exactly </em> like our dad.  Some say my siblings and I are clones of my Mother.  I get my humor and sarcasm from my Dad and get my maturity and smarts from my mom.  My family loves to joke around with eachother.  We make fun of eachother alot but  in the end, we all know we love eachother... a lot.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Random</h4>
        <p>My favorite quote:</p> 
        <blockquote> "Stuff doesn't matter - boats, cars, fancy things don't matter. What matters, what will matter to me, is the love of the people around me, and did I take a chance? Did I seize an opportunity to do something for people with the talents that I was lucky enough to be given? Did I make a difference in the lives of people who needed me?" -James Comey</blockquote> 
        <p>My favorite movies: <i> The Maze Runner <!-- all movies in the series -->, The Outsiders,</i> and <i>Suicide Squad.</i></p>
        <p>My favorite food: Mac-n-cheese bites, Jalepe√±o cheese sticks, and Cream of broccoli soup.</p>
